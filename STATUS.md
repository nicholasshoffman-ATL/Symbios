# Project Status — Symbios Site Rebuild

**Date:** 2026-07-18

## 2026-07-18 — dropdown typography
- Dropdown links now match the top-level nav exactly: **13px / weight 500 / uppercase / .05em** (were .9rem, mixed case, weight 300 inherited from body). Live styles the whole menu as one unit so both levels share type; the rebuild had only styled level 1. Verified identical computed type on the main site and sub-brands.
- **Open decision:** uppercasing makes the one-word brand names read `PRIMARYCARE` / `PHYSIOTHERAPY` / `SYMBIOSFIT` / `SYMBIOSARIA` (live showed two words: "PRIMARY CARE"). Consistent with the client's one-word directive, but the camelCase readability cue is lost — confirm with client.

## 2026-07-18 — header logo sizing + dropdown animation
- **Logo sizing corrected to the live spec.** The live sites size each lockup so every brand's header logo lands at ~322px wide: main site 80px tall (430x107 source), sub-brands 100px (345x107) at >=1381px, 80px below. The rebuild used a flat 80px everywhere, which made the wider SymbiosHealth lockup render 321x80 vs 258x80 for the others — reading ~24% larger. Now verified at 1500px: Health 321w, PrimaryCare/PhysioTherapy/SymbiosFit 322w, SymbiosAria 336w.
- **Nav dropdowns now unroll** like the live nav (Impreza `dropdown_height`): `scaleY(0)->1` from the top edge + opacity fade, .3s. Replaces the instant `display:none/block`. Added `:focus-within` for keyboard users, a `prefers-reduced-motion` opt-out, and a transform reset for the mobile stacked menu.
- Not exercised live: the hover animation itself couldn't be triggered in the automation context (Browser pane wasn't compositing, so pseudo-classes/style recalc are frozen). Resting state and rule matching were verified programmatically; **worth a quick eyeball in a real browser.**

## 2026-07-18 — SymbiosFit phone correction
- **Client correction: SymbiosFit line is (843) 738-4600, not 4604.** Updated all 57 occurrences site-wide — topbars/footers on the 11 fit pages, every `tel:` link, the homepage LocalBusiness department schema, llms.txt, README, SITE-SPEC, SEO-REVIEW — so NAP stays consistent. Verified 0 stale `4604` remain.
- Removed the Port Royal Plaza address from the SymbiosFit card in the homepage "Where Would You Like to Start?" grid so all four campus cards match. The satellite address intentionally remains in the /fit/ footers, fit map embed, and JSON-LD.
- Repo moved to `C:\dev\Symbios` (was Downloads\brooke fin); preview launch.json path updated.

## 2026-07-13 — PrimaryCare consultation + copy fix
- Added ToDoList.md (SymbiosFit hours tabled there per client), branded 404.html (Render serves it automatically), and REDIRECTS.md — full 301 map for old subdomain + www URLs ready for Cloudflare/Render at cutover
- SymbiosFit real address applied (Port Royal Plaza, 95 Mathews Dr, Suite D3): all 11 fit footers, fit homepage map embed, fit JSON-LD (stale campus geo dropped), gateway door card + department schema, llms.txt
- PrimaryCare now has its own green-branded /primary-care/request-a-consultation/ (form, hours, new-patient-forms link); all 10 PrimaryCare pages retargeted off the SymbiosHealth form
- Gateway and llms.txt: removed "one address" claim (SymbiosFit has a nearby satellite space); sitemap regenerated (47 URLs)

## 2026-07-12 — campus gateway homepage
- Final link sweep: 46 pages internal links/assets all resolve; 28 unique external URLs verified live (initial 403s were the live site WAF rate-limiting the checker) — one real 404 found and unlinked (past-dated /event/ webinar on advanced-ed-solutions); sitemap.xml regenerated (46 URLs), robots.txt staging-blocked with flip-at-launch note, llms.txt added
- Client feedback: brand names rendered as one word (SymbiosHealth, PrimaryCare, PhysioTherapy, SymbiosFit, SymbiosAria) in the campus bar, nav dropdowns, door buttons, footer brand lines, copyrights and intro kicker — 519 references across 46 pages; prose sentences untouched
- Hero second CTA fixed (was white-on-white via .btn-outline collision) with new .btn-ghost class; mobile audit: newsletter signup image was forcing 65px horizontal overflow at 375px — capped with min(420px,100%); hamburger/doors/brand-bar verified good on mobile
- Intro exit smoothed: scrollbar-gutter reserved during lock (was causing a 15px mid-fade layout shift), scroll unlock deferred until fade completes, fade lengthened to 1.2s with will-change compositing
- Intro rebuilt as a title sequence after feedback (corner fly-in read as cheap; flex bug jumbled the tagline): kicker + hairline rule, brands shown one at a time at 440px, word-by-word tagline, Symbios lockup, soft fade exit (~10.4s, skippable)
- Intro logos enlarged to 400px with a new hold phase: fly in to a 2x2 spread, hold readable ~1.7s, then converge; Symbios logo also 400px; total sequence ~9.2s
- Intro animation fixes after live review: convergence point was 325px off-center on desktop (min() vs transform centering bug) — now transform-centered at all widths; timeline slowed from ~4.4s to ~7.6s
- Root homepage is now a neutral Symbios campus gateway: hero ("One Campus. Every Dimension of Your Health."), four brand door panels with accent colors/services/phones, one-team section, testimonials, map
- Intro animation overlay: brand logos converge into Symbios, tagline slides in, logo rises, curtain lift (~4.4s); skippable, once per session (sessionStorage), honors prefers-reduced-motion, content rendered beneath for SEO
- Root JSON-LD now lists the four sub-brands as department entries

## Just completed
## 2026-07-12 — brand-consistency + SEO round
- Newsletter eyebrow reworded: "We don&#39;t keep secrets" (odd tone for a medical campus) is now "Wellness tips from our experts" on all 46 pages
- Cross-brand navigation: persistent dark campus-switcher bar on all 46 pages (current brand highlighted); "Our Brands" renamed "Our Campus" in nav and section headings
- Fixed 1,328 doubled-quote attribute bugs left by the clean-URL rewrite (44 files)
- Rebuilt Symbios Health logo script word "Health" in Yellowtail to match Therapy/Care (assets/symbioshealth_tagline.png, 21 refs updated)
- Footers: brand name above address + brand-matched copyrights (SymbiosAria/SymbiosFit/PrimaryCare/PhysioTherapy by Symbios Health)
- Removed the Home nav item on all pages (logo is the home link)
- Aria-branded /medspa/about-us/ and /medspa/request-a-consultation/ (live med spa content, cyan Aria scheme); all med spa CTAs now stay in-brand
- SEO: per-brand LocalBusiness JSON-LD on the 5 index pages, sitemap.xml (46 URLs), robots.txt (staging-blocked until cutover), 3 NAP phone fixes; full audit in SEO-REVIEW.md

- Clean URLs for Render hosting: all 39 non-index pages moved to `slug/index.html` folders, every internal link/asset/background rewritten to root-absolute paths with no `.html` (e.g. `/primary-care/mens-health/`); verified all 44 clean URLs + assets resolve locally
- Root `favicon.ico` added (from the Symbios icon) alongside the per-brand `<link rel="icon">` tags
- Detailed 44-page parity pass against the live sites (5 parallel audits + fixes):
  - Header corrected to live spec: cream 41px topbar, WHITE 120px nav row, 80px logo, cream dropdowns w/ brand hover; body type 17px/26px
  - Rotating hero sliders on all 5 homepages (Royal Slider timing: 1s fade / 3s autoplay); Google Maps section added to the 4 sub-brand homepages
  - Inner pages rebuilt to live pattern: flat brand-color h1 title band + intro photo as left split column (29 pages); root inner bands coral
  - Forms wired to the client's real ActiveCampaign embeds (request-an-appointment id20, fit consultation id20, physio appointments id21, email signups id3/id15) + Dover job-board iframe on careers — resolves the "forms need a handler" punch-list item
  - Primary Care: 4 dark brand bands, 2 misplaced images moved to "How It Works" sections, alternation fixes, 4 sexual-health tiles linked (to live pages pending migration)
  - Physio: homepage section order fixed, invented 7th card removed, Why-Choose images flipped right on 5 pages, 2-col service lists, 3-col offer grids, live metas restored
  - About pages: team cards converted to live View Bio popup modals (verified working)
  - Live footers replicated (logo left, right-aligned address/socials/per-brand copyright), per-brand favicons, en-dash titles, brand-first index titles, nav dropdown trimmed to live's 5 items, invented CTAs/cards/sections removed, Aria header logo corrected to arialogo-1.png
- Items intentionally NOT carried over (flag to client): UserWay accessibility widget, GA4 tag, header search overlay, blog pagination pages 2–17 (outbound link instead), blog-single category sidebar on the ED post
- Brand logo PNGs (18 files: main/primary-care/physio/aria taglines across all hosts) converted from white-background to true transparency (alpha unmix), matching the Fit logo — brand strips and headers now blend into the cream sections
- Live-site animations replicated in assets/site.js + CSS: scroll-reveal fade-up/fade-left (Impreza us_animate_this afb/afl), staggered grid/brand-strip items, hero intro animation, back-to-top arrow button; respects prefers-reduced-motion; wired into all 44 pages
- Full UI-parity pass against the live sites: per-brand accent palettes (main coral #F15C58, Fit taupe #A29382/#786c5f, Primary Care green #4EA647, Physio magenta #A81A8D, Aria cyan #1BBED5) via body classes; live Impreza typography (Cormorant h1 60px/h2 49px, accent-colored h3/h4/eyebrows); topbar CTA buttons (brand + dark); curved SVG hero divider on all 5 homepages; italic hero phrase on main; What-We-Do rebuilt as icon boxes with hand-drawn SVG line icons (live uses FA Pro Light — not redistributable, so drawn from scratch); LEARN MORE text links; white/gray outline buttons; brand-color subscribe band with email_signup.png image button; Google Maps embed on homepage; SVG social icons in all footers; header made static (live is non-sticky). All 44 pages verified locally: zero broken/external images.
- All 156 hotlinked wp-content images/PDF downloaded and rehosted under `assets/wp/<host>/...`; every HTML reference rewritten to relative local paths (0 wp-content refs remain, all pages verified loading locally)
- Symbios Fit logo created from the client's original Edge logo (same icon, wordmark, tagline, colors; "Fit" in matching script) and applied to all 16 pages that used the text lockup
- Full static rebuild of mysymbios.com + all 4 sub-brand sites (44 pages), pushed to GitHub `main`
- Primary Care final pass merged: full 6-item services nav on all pages, men's health treatment links restored (link check clean)
- "SymbiosEdge / The Edge" rebranded to **Symbios Fit** throughout (text lockup logo, `/fit/` section, "Edge Rx" → "Fit Rx")
- All internal links verified (0 broken); per-brand phone numbers and CTAs verified against live site

## In progress
- Nothing in flight

## Next steps
- Client review of flagged items (see README "Outstanding items"): Fit logo asset, Fit social handles, "Fit Rx" / "The Mobility Edge" naming, past-dated webinar on advanced-ed-solutions page, and whether to carry over UserWay / GA4 / header search / blog pagination
- Migrate the 4 women's sexual-health treatment pages (FemiLift, O-Shot, Alma Duo for Enhanced Sexual Function, PRP Wing Lift) — tiles currently link to the live site
- Decide hosting/domain for Fit (fit.mysymbios.com) and DNS cutover plan; forms now use the client's ActiveCampaign embeds, so no separate form backend is needed
- athenahealth API: if pursuing integration, register at developer portal (Preview sandbox is self-service; production needs practice authorization + BAA)
