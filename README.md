# Symbios Health — Site Rebuild (Symbios Fit rebrand)

Static rebuild of mysymbios.com and its sub-brand sites, with the former
"SymbiosEdge / The Edge" brand renamed to **Symbios Fit**.

## Structure
- `/` — main Symbios Health site (home, about, blog listing, appointment, careers, privacy, email signup, advanced ED solutions)
- `/fit/` — Symbios Fit (formerly theedge.mysymbios.com), 11 pages
- `/primary-care/` — Symbios Primary Care, 10 pages
- `/physiotherapy/` — Symbios Physio Therapy, 9 pages
- `/medspa/` — Symbios Aria med spa, 6 pages
- `assets/style.css` — shared stylesheet (palette/type sourced from the live Impreza theme)
- `assets/wp/<host>/...` — all images (and the new-patient PDF) downloaded from the live wp-content uploads, mirrored per source host; nothing is hotlinked anymore

## Outstanding items (flagged in HTML comments in the pages)
- Symbios Fit logo: derived from the original Edge logo (assets/symbiosfit_tagline.png, transparent bg; _nocheck variant available) — "Fit" set in Allura script matched to the original color/size. Client should confirm or supply an official vector version
- Social profiles still carry The Edge handles (facebook 61578321875531, instagram @theedgebysymbioshealth, linkedin the-edge-by-symbios-health)
- "Edge Rx" renamed to "Fit Rx" and "The Mobility Edge" program name kept — confirm with client
- Forms are static (`action="#"`) — need a form handler (live site uses WordPress forms)
- Blog: page 1 posts carded (linking to live posts); pages 2–17 not migrated
- Careers "open positions" embed and email-signup embed were not extractable from the live site
